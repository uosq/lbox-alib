# **Please download alib.lua from Releases page!!!**
I like making useless things that probably only I will use :)

**Use a version from the releases page if possible, they are all (possibly) stable enough to be released**

currently this has `window, button, checkbox and slider` support

read the wiki if you have any problem

Preview of the example.lua:
