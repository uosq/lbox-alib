I like making useless things that probably only I will use :)

Console commands use my other lib called 'Console lib', yes ik very original name but it works lol

[console lib](https://github.com/uosq/console-lib)

**Use a version from the releases page if possible, they are all (possibly) stable enough to be released**

currently this has `window,button,checkbox,combobox and slider` support, all the properties can be changed and used like a normal table

read the wiki if you have any problem
